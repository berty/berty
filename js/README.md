```bash
$ make ios.debug
$ IOS_DEVICE="your-emulator-id" make ios.debug

# üí° You can check available virtual iOS devices with
$ xcrun simctl list
```

Run Android in debug mode:

```bash
$ make android.debug
# Optional if using only one device
# Run this with different Android device IDs
$ ANDROID_DEVICE="your-emulator-id" make android.debug
$ ANDROID_DEVICE="your-emulator-id" make android.debug

# üí° You can check available Android Virtual Devices with
$ adb devices
```

```bash
# Optional if not modifying any .proto file
# Generate files using protobuf
$ make generate

# Optional if using only one device
# Run this with different ports to test with multiple devices
$ BERTY_DAEMON_PORT=1337 make daemon.start
$ BERTY_DAEMON_PORT=1338 make daemon.start

# Web
# Run Berty daemon for the web app

## Setup

### The Berty Messenger installation involves:

1. Installing the global dependencies
2. Installing the dependencies for IOS
3. Installing the dependencies for Android

<details><summary>Install the common dependencies (mandatory)</summary>

1. Install `asdf` tool version manager following its [tutorial](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).

> **Warning**: if you are using `nvm` you may face some incompatibility issues with `asdf` during the build process.

2. Run the initial setup script in the root project's folder:

   ```bash
   $ cd berty # root folder
   $ make asdf.install_tools

   # if you have an issue related with gpg, eg:
   #  - "Missing one or more of the following dependencies: tar, gpg"
   # Try solving this with `$ brew install gpg`
   ```

3. Install the [General React Native requirements](#general-react-native-requirements)
4. [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install/) to enable live reloading
5. [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
6. `$GOPATH` may need to be set explicitly (usually `$HOME/go`)

<details><summary>IOS dev requirements</summary>

- Mac OS X
- [XCode _(latest stable)_](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Xcode)

</details>

<details><summary>Android dev requirements</summary>

- An Android app **development environment**, e.g. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)
- **Android SDK**, with the following enabled (in Android Studio Code in `Tools --> SDK Manager`):
  - SDK Platform "Android 11.0 (R)"
  - Android SDK Build-Tools
  - LLDB
  - NDK version 23.1.7779620 (`export ANDROID_NDK_HOME="$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/23.1.7779620"`)
  - Cmake
  - Android SDK Command-line Tools
- A physical or virtual **Android device** (in Android Studio, `Tools --> AVD Manager`)
- **Java 8**. If you already have another version of Java, you can use a version manager and Homebrew to add another installation. Some nice instructions are given [here](https://java.christmas/2019/16).

üí° Check you can run all the commands `sdkmanager`, `emulator`, `ndk-bundle`, and `adb` (these are binaries in `$ANDROID_HOME` subfolders)
